Due to the development of powerful image editing software, image processing and content change has become a simple task. 
Unfortunately, most of the time, these changes are designed to deceive the audience, change their minds, and even influence how people interpret the truth. 
Therefore, the development of efficient forgery detection technology has become a research hotspot. 
Image synthesis is one of the most interesting forms of image forgery. 
This forgery combines elements from two or more photos to create new truths based on scenes that never happened. 
Since it is still difficult to achieve complete light matching in forged images, illumination irregularity is considered to be the most promising of all 
signal devices for detecting image components. This study draws on the idea that image splicing anti-counterfeiting location method based on local noise 
inconsistency is a reliable and effective proof of image structure, and extends the existing two image mosaic anti-counterfeiting location methods based on 
light source mapping.

SO FIRST THING YOU SHOULD DO IS
OPEN PYCHARM
INSTALL REQUIREMENTS TO YOUR VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT
CHOOSE IMAGE in path = glob.glob("./TESTS/1920x1080/test1_fake.jpg") (I GAVE SOME PICTURES)
RUN IT) ENJOY)

*By the way, You should give BLOCK size of course
